# Introduction

This is a collection of R scripts to help with https://political-arithmetic.blogspot.com/

Well, kind of. The organization intended (following Jekyll):

- `/assets/` contains the images produced from the R scripts
- `/posts/` contains the R Markdown notes to myself, mostly showing the
  work for something; think of these as "Notebooks"
- `/R/` contains helper scripts
- `/data/` contains a bunch of subdirectories, each with a README 
  detailing the source, format, etc., of the data in the subdirectory
